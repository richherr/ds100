# # Exploratory Data Analysis
# 
# The term Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short) refers to the process of discovering traits about our data that inform future analysis.
# 
# Here's the `students` table from the previous page:

# In[3]:


students


# We are left with a number of questions. How many students are in this roster? What does the `Role` column mean? We conduct EDA in order to understand our data more thoroughly.
# 
# Oftentimes, we explore the data by repeatedly posing questions as we uncover more information.
# 
# **How many students are in our dataset?**

# In[4]:


print("There are", len(students), "students on the roster.")


# A natural follow-up question: does this dataset contain the complete list of students? In this case, this table contains all students in one semester's offering of Data 100.

# **What is the meaning of the `Role` field?**
# 
# We often example the field's data in order to understand the field itself.

# In[5]:


students['Role'].value_counts().to_frame()


# We can see here that our data contain not only students enrolled in the class at the time but also the students on the waitlist. The `Role` column tells us whether each student is enrolled.
# 
# **What about the names?  How can we summarize this field?**
# 
# In Data 100 we will work with many different kinds of data, including numerical, categorical, and text data. Each type of data has its own set of tools and techniques.
# 
# A quick way to start understanding the names is to examine the lengths of the names.

# In[6]:


sns.distplot(students['Name'].str.len(),
             rug=True,
             bins=np.arange(12),
             axlabel="Number of Characters")
plt.xlim(0, 12)
plt.xticks(np.arange(12))
plt.ylabel('Proportion per character');


# This visualization shows us that most names are between 3 and 9 characters long. This gives us a chance to check whether our data seem reasonable â€” if there were many names that were 1 character long we'd have good reason to re-examine our data.

# ## What's in a Name?
# 
# Although this dataset is rather simple, we will soon see that first names alone can reveal quite a bit about our group of students.
