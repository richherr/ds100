# # The Data Science Lifecycle
# 
# In data science, we use large and diverse data sets to make conclusions about
# the world. In this book we discuss principles and techniques of
# data science through the two lens of computational and inferential thinking.
# Practically speaking, this involves the following process:
# 
# 1. Formulating a question or problem
# 2. Acquiring and cleaning data
# 3. Conducting exploratory data analysis
# 4. Using prediction and inference to draw conclusions
# 
# It is quite common for more questions and problems to emerge after the last
# step of this process, so we repeatedly engage in this procedure to
# discover new characteristics of our data. This positive feedback loop is so
# central to our work that we call it the **data science lifecycle**.
# 
# While simple to state, the data science lifecycle takes training and practice
# to do well. In fact, each topic in this book revolves around a piece of this
# lifecycle. We think learning to do data science is both challenging and
# rewarding â€“ we'll show you by starting with an example.
