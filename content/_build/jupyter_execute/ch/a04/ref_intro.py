# # Reference Tables
# 
# This appendix contains reference tables for the `pandas`, `seaborn`,
# `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` methods used in the book. It is meant to
# provide a helpful overview of the small subset of methods that we use most
# often in this book.
# 
# For each library, we list the methods used, the chapter where each method is
# first mentioned, and a brief description of the method's functionality.
