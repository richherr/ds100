# # Philosophy for Data Visualization
# 
# Unfortunately, many charts in the world at large do not adhere to our
# principles for data visualization. Here is a page of charts that appear on the
# first page of a Google search for "good data visualization" conducted in Spring
# of 2018. How many poorly made charts can you spot?

# Effective data visualization reveals the data. All of our principles for
# visualization aim to make the data more understandable for the viewer. Data
# visualization is sometimes used to mislead and misinform. When done properly,
# however, data visualization is one of our greatest tools for discovering,
# revealing, and communicating trends and anomalies in our data.
